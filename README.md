# Project: Personal Expense Tracker
## Objective:
Create a simple command-line program that allows users to track their daily expenses. The program will allow the user to input expenses, categorize them, and view the total spent in each category.

## Requirements:
* __User Input:__ Collect input from the user using input() for expense name, amount, and category.
* __Data Storage:__ Use dictionaries and lists to store expenses. For example, use a dictionary where keys are categories (like "Food," "Transportation," etc.), and values are lists of tuples representing the expense name and amount.
* __Basic Logic:__ Implement basic control flow using if, elif, and else to handle different user actions (e.g., adding an expense, viewing total expenses, and quitting the program).
* __Functions:__ Break down the program into smaller functions to handle tasks like adding an expense, viewing totals, etc.

## Bonus Features:
* __Persistent Storage:__ Use a text file to save expenses, so they persist between sessions. You can use file handling techniques to read and write expenses to a file.
* __Input Validation:__ Ensure that the user inputs valid data (e.g., the amount should be a number).
* __Search Functionality:__ Allow the user to search for expenses by name or category.

## Key Concepts Reinforced:
1. Input/Output: Working with input() and print() to interact with the user.
2. Data Structures: Using lists and dictionaries to store and organize data.
3. Control Flow: Implementing logic using if statements to manage different user actions.
4. Functions: Breaking the program into functions to make the code more modular and easier to maintain.

This project should align well with the first four lessons of the course and provide a good foundation for further exploration of Python programming concepts.
